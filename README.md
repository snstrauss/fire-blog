## Description

A simple blog website, with data coming from [{JSON}Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The website is responsive, and will look good on mobile as well as on desktop, but viewing on desktop is preferred, so you can check out some of the nice, more interesting layouts and hover effects.

The website supports both English and Hebrew translations, while retaining user selection in local-storage to provide the user with a pleasant and reliable experience.

## Tech Stack

- The website is developed in **React**
- Bundled with **Vite**
- Uses **react-router-dom** for client-side routing
- Utilizes local fonts provided by **Fontsource**.
- Deployed using **Surge.sh**

## What's missing?

- **Typescript**  
  Sadly, I don't have any real-world experience with Typescript, so I chose not to try and add it, in order to save time and keep the code clean.  
  That being said, I am willing and able to get professional in any tool necessary.

- **Accessibility Support**  
  Sadly, I don't have any real-world experience with modern a11y techniques, and chose not to spend any time on it.

- **Testing**  
  There isn't much logic to test here, so I decided against adding any, to save time.

- **A Designer!**  
  I am not, nor am I interested in being, a Graphic Designer.  
  I styled the website to the best of my abilities, but it could certainly look better.
